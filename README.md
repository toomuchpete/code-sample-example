# Code Sample for Jordan Smith

My name is Jordan Smith and I've been working with Ruby for twelve months. I interned
at Cool Software Company, which is a Ruby on Rails shop, and I have a number of side
projects that I've been using to better understand Ruby.

This repository contains excerpts from those projects and also some code from my
internship used with permission.

1. **Sports League Standings Updater** -- For a local rec-sports league's website, we  
   have to calculate the new league rankings after each week's games. The website is  
   written in Ruby on Rails and the code runs in a nightly job. It's a good example
   of my understanding of separation of concerns in an Object-Oriented application.
 
2. **Sports League Rainout Notifications** -- For that same league, we send  
   notifications by text or email when a player's game is rained out. We want  
   to make them confirm the phone number or email address in most cases. This  
   sample demonstrates the use of asynchronous jobs and external APIs.

_Note: this repository contains code written by [Pete Holiday](https://github.com/toomuchpete), 
but it's just an example of what a junior engineer's code sample might look like._
