# Code Sample for Jordan Smith

My name is Jordan Smith and I've been working with Ruby for twelve months. I interned
at Cool Software Company, which is a Ruby on Rails shop, and I have a number of side
projects that I've been using to better understand Ruby.

This repository contains excerpts from those projects and also some code from my
internship used with permission.

_Note: this repository contains code written by [Pete Holiday](https://github.com/toomuchpete), 
but it's just an example of what a junior engineer's code sample might look like._
